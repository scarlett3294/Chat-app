# Family CHATroom
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/HOBx3lGwSq4>
#### Description: 
  Family CHATroom is a user-friendly web-based application designed for family members living within the same local network (e.g., at the same home address). It offers a seamless and convenient way for family members to stay connected, share updates, and communicate effortlessly.
#### Installation:
  Before you begin, make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.
  I recommend using a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies.
  Here's how to set up a virtual environment and install the required packages:
#### 1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
  If you're using venv: python -m venv venv
  If you're using virtualenv: virtualenv venv
#### 2. Activate the virtual environment:
  On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  On macOS and Linux: source venv/bin/activate
#### 3. Install project dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
#### 4. To initialize database run: python app.py
#### 5. To run the app for real-time messaging, use the following command: flask run --host=0.0.0.0
  This command enables real-time messaging across different devices.

#### Visit http://< your-ip >:5000 in your web browser to access the application (computer/ phone)
#### Replace <your-ip> with your server's IP address.
#### To deactivate the virtual environment when you're done, simply run: deactivate
